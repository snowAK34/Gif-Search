# Gif-Search

## Description

A simple gif search that brings up gifs related to a particular topic on a button click.

## Usage

This app uses gifs pulled from the Giphy API.  It is set to pull ten gifs using the topic displayed in the button as the search term.  These buttons are dynamically generated from an array.

The theme of the app was designed around breeds of dogs, but the input field for adding a button does not have restrictions with regard to subject.

## Roadmap

Going forward, I would like to improve the design of the page to make it look better.

I would also like to add some of the bonus functions that had been suggested as a part of this exercise.

I'd also like to add the ability to be able to remove buttons that were added.
